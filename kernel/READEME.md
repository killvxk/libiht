# Kernel (Kernelspace Driver/Module Components)

The `kernel` directory contains the kernelspace driver/module component of LIBIHT. It provides a convenient interface for accessing and utilizing Intel hardware trace capabilities from kernelspace applications.

## Building and Usage

Please refer to the README files in the [`kmd`](./kmd/README.md), and [`lkm`](./lkm/README.md) directories for instructions on building the kernelspace components of LIBIHT.
