# Demo

The `demo` directory contains some simple demo application that utilizes the LIBIHT library to access and utilize Intel hardware trace capabilities. The demo applications are intended to demonstrate the usage of the LIBIHT library, i.e. enable/disable hardware trace capabilities for a given process id (PID), dump the Last Branch Record (LBR) stack information for a given PID, and update the LBR selection bits for a given PID, etc.

## Building

Each demo application has its own Makefile. Navigate to their corresponding directory and follow the instructions in their README files to build the demo applications.
